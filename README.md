This is my personal git workflow; it might not be a good one; please help to improve it

## What is origin, upstream?

**repo** is from repository, in git world it means the place we keep code.

**origin** is an alias name, we use to call the repo on the server which we clone it.

**upstream** is an alias name, we use to call the repo on the server where the main project is.

**local**, or **local repo** is the way we call the repo (folder) on our working folder's local machine.
